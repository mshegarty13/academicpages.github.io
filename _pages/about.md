Hello! My name is Maura Hegarty. I am a first-year masters student studying [operations research](https://orc.mit.edu/) at MIT advised by Professor [Dimitris Bertsimas](https://dbertsim.mit.edu/). I am interested in optimization and machine learning in health care and transportation. Currently, I am working in applications of optimization and machine learning in organ transplantation.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree in pure and applied mathematics at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. I graduated in May of 2022.
